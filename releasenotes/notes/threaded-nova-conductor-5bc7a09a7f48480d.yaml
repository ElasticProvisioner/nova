    The nova-conductor services now can be run in native threading
    mode instead of with eventlet. This is an experimental feature that is
    disabled by default. Please test the native threading mode in
    pre-production before enabling it in production. Please read the
    `concurrency <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/concurrency.html>`__
    guide for more details.
